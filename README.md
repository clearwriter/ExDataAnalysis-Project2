# Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it says about 
fine particulate matter pollution in the United States over the 10-year period from 1999-2008. 

Each R file begins with instructions for loading the provided datasets. The true assignment-specific code will be found 
below the reiteration of the question. At the end of the code, you will find a result analysis which interprets the plot 
that was generated by the code.

For each question, you will find:
* R code (such as plot1.R)
* And the corresponding png file (such as plot1.png) generated by the aforementioned R code
